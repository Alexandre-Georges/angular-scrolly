<h1><code ng:non-bindable=""></code>
<span class="hint"></span>

<div><h1 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h2>

<h4 id="css">CSS</h5>

<p>To fix a few CSS problems, add this to your stylesheet:</p>

<pre><code class="css">* {
  -webkit-backface-visibility-hidden;
}
html, body {
  -webkit-user-select: none;
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="whyshouldidothat">Why should I do that?</h5>

<p>The <code>-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;</code> will fix a known problem when trying
to animate an element that is bigger than its viewport.  In other words, it will
fix a flickering problem that happens sometimes.</p>

<p>The <code>-webkit-user-select: none;</code> will stop the copy/paste dialog from coming up
on items the user is scrolling.  If you <em>do</em> want some things copy/paste-able in
your app (eg <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags), I would advise making a <code>.selectable</code> class, which allows the user to 
select, and then placing that only where it's needed.</p></div>
