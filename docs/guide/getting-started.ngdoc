To get started with angular-scrolly, follow these steps:

#### 1. Get the Javascript file. 

You have a few options.

* You can install it on bower (TODO):

```
bower install ajoslin/angular-scrolly
```

* You can simply download it from github (TODO):

[http://raw.github.com/ajoslin/angular-scrolly/master/angular-scrolly.js](http://raw.github.com/ajoslin/angular-scrolly/master/angular-scrolly.js)

* You can clone the repository and build it. See the [project README](http://github.com/ajoslin/angular-scrolly).

#### 2. Include the javascript file in your HTML and as an angular dependency.

<pre>
<script src="angular-scrolly.js"></script>
</pre>
<pre>
angular.module('myAwesomeApp', ['ajoslin.angular-scrolly']);
</pre>

#### 3. Throw in a `scrolly-scroll` directive
